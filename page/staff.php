<br />
<strong><a href=\"index.php?page=profile&id=1\">teknoTom</a></strong>
<div>teknoTom was the original creator of CHERUB Quest. He used the ezRPG engine to make the game and originally uploaded it to a crappy little server somewhere. It has since been much improved and Tom now has little importance in the project =P</div>
<br />
<strong><a href=\"index.php?page=profile&id=16\">CommanderOne</a></strong>
<div>Justin now hosts CHERUB Quest on his server, which we are very grateful for. It was his idea to improve the coding and site and without him the site wouldn't exist as it does today.</div>
<br />
<strong><a href=\"index.php?page=profile&id=24\">Josh04</a></strong>
<div>Josh overhauled the site when work was initially developed, including the code within it and the system it used to display information. His l33t PHP skills made the site the envy of others around and made a good benchmark from which he and others could develop it.</div>
<br />
<strong><a href=\"index.php?page=profile&id=8\">JamieHD</a></strong>
<div>Jamie's coding has also been used on the site and we are incredibly grateful for the features he has added to the site. Working as a sort-of odd-job man, Jamie has helped work on various areas of the site and personally created some of the features we use today.</div>
<br />
<strong><a href=\"index.php?page=profile&id=65\">Grego</a></strong>
<div>Greg joined the site to help with the PHP. He's recently come back to try and reignite it, making it better so that it can be used again.</div>
<br />
<strong><span style=\"color:#00F;text-decoration:underline;\">Other Thanks</span></strong>
<div>Obviously, we have to thank Zeggy, the creator of ezRPG. His initial code kicked off this project, though very little of it remains today. Also, .uni.cc must be thanked for their free domain service. Thanks to you, as users, for supporting the project and for providing feedback where necessary. And thanks to anyone else who's offered support throughout the creation of this site.</div
